# React Lights Out (Springboard Exercise 39.7.8)

## Functionality

This is a small puzzle game created using [React](https://reactjs.org/). The game starts out with some board cells that are lit, and the goal of the user is to make all of the cells unlit. When a cell is clicked on, that toggles the light of that cell, as well as the cells above, below, to the right, and to the left of it. The main goal of this exercise was to get some practice with component design in react.

## Technicalities

- To get this code onto your machine, run `git clone https://github.com/jlh040/react-lights-out.git`
- Then, make sure you have Node.js installed, `cd` into the project directory, and run `npm install` to download all of the required packages.
- Next, run `npm start` and the game should show up in your browser.
